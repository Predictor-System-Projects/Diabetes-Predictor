# Diabetes-Predictor
Made using Support Vector Machine Algorithm (SVM) in Python.  
Made mainly for Women, Men can also use it by putting the Pregnancy value as 0. (This may however affect the accuracy)   
# Prediction Logic and Requirements:-  
This Model predicts if a person is Diabetes Positive or Negative based on the following Data entered:-   
1) Pregnancy (0 if none)   
2) Glucose.  
3) BloodPressure.  
4) SkinThickness. 
5) Insulin.  
6) BMI.  
7) DiabetesPedigreeFunction.  
8) Age.  
# Accuracy    
On Training Data:- 78%   
On Testing Data:- 77%

NOTE:- A split of 80%-20% was done to seperate Training and Testing Data respectively.
